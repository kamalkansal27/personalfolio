            <h3>Learn Competitive Programming in a easy way</h3>
            <p>competitive programming is a mind
            sport where everyone showcase his/her skills of problem solving
            under various constraints(that force everyone to think deeply or
            efficiently). Anyone who does competitive programming can enhance
            his/her problem solving approaches.You will learn how to approach a
            problem with the best of the best possible ways, you will learn how
            to analytically think and solve a problem and analyze it's space and
            time complexity.</p>
